I follow the swift-evolution and swift-server-dev mailing list with great love.</p><p>I already have a education as a Game and Multimedia Developer and worked one year at Sablono GmbH in Berlin. But that wasnâ€™t enough for me. I wanted to deepen my knowledge about algorithms, low level programming and software architecture. That was the reason I have started to study computer science at the University for applied Science Mannheim in the autumn of 2016. It makes fun and I have already learned so many new things. It was definitely the right decision to go back to school.</p><p>I believe because I have practical experience, I can see the use case for many abstract topics other students canâ€™t think off. They often complain that they donâ€™t see the reason why they should learn something and think they will never use it again after that course. To help them, I try to explain why they should care and show them an example use case. After that they are really thankful and often more motivated to learn for an abstract topic.</p><p>Since the introduction of Swift at WWDC14, Iâ€™m continuously hacking on different iOS Apps but no App has left my Mac. That changed in late 2016. I published my first iOS and watchOS App on the App Store: MyTimetable - for HS-Mannheim. It is a simple course schedule for my University. In early 2017 I also created my first Mac App to solve the Travelings Salesman Problem. It was part of my submission for the Code Competition from IT-Talents.de.</p><p>In April 2017, I created a Swift Playground Book for the iPad. It is a tutorial on programming the famous arcade game â€žSnakeâ€œ, addressing intermediate users. That was part of my submission to Apple for a Scholarship to receive a WWDC 2017 ticket.<br>Iâ€™m proud to say that I have been awarded a WWDC Scholarship ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠ.</p></article></section><footer><ul><li><a href="/imprint.html">Imprint</a></li><li><a href="/contact.html">Contact</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/DNadoba">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-nadoba-547724b2/">LinkedIn</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
